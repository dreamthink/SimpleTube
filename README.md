<p><strong>OVERVIEW: </strong><br>
SimpleTube is a YouTube experience with minimal distractions. Comments, number of views and likes are not displayed to create a minimal feel with simply videos. This project utilizes the YouTube API and returns 48 videos relevant to your search terms. Videos open with <a href="http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/" target="_blank">fancyBox Lightbox</a>.</p>
<p><strong>CHALLENGES:</strong><br>
I found that some of the images returned from the API request were not video still images but avatar images or YouTube channel images, which created some initial bugs. A different data property was selected to ensure that the image was related to a video. Long video titles created some issues with displaying the results cleanly as they pushed the videos to a new row, so these titles were given their own div size.
